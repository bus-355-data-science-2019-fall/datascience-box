# Hello world!

## What is data science?

- &lt;i class="fa fa-database fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i class="fa fa-flask fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = data science?
--

- &lt;i class="fa fa-database fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i class="fa fa-code fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = data science?
--

- &lt;i class="fa fa-database fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i class="fa fa-user fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i class="fa fa-code fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = data science?
--

- &lt;i class="fa fa-database fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i class="fa fa-users fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i class="fa fa-code fa"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = data science?

&lt;br&gt;

Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

# What is this course?

This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

--

**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

--

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics `\(\ne\)` data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is **not** your typical high school statistics course.

--

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

---

# What is this course?

**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

--

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

--

**Q: Why not language X?**  
A: We can discuss that over â˜•.

## Create a GitHub account

.instructions[
Go to [github.com](https://github.com/), and create an account (unless you already have one). 
]

Tips for selecting a username:&lt;sup&gt;âœ¦&lt;/sup&gt;

.midi[
- Incorporate your actual name.
- Reuse username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you'll be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Donâ€™t highlight your current university, employer, etc.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.

## &lt;i class="fas fa-laptop"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; `AE 01 - UN Votes` 

Create your first data visualization!

- Log on to RStudio Cloud and click on this course's workspace.
- Make a copy of the project for this application exercise and launch it.
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `unvotes.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Then, change the country names to those you're interested in. Your spelling and capitalization should match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to confirm spelling. Knit again. And voila, your first data visualization!

# Course structure and policies

---

## Class meetings

- Interactive
- Some lectures, lots of learn-by-doing
- Bring your laptop to class every day

---

## How to get help

- Course content, logistics, etc. discussion on course Canvas site.
- Often it's a lot more pleasant an experience to get your questions answered in person. 
- For personal and grade related questions, direct message me on Canvas or use email.

---

## Academic integrity

- Only work that is clearly assigned as team work can be completed collaboratively.
- Use of disallowed materials during the take home exam will not be tolerated.

---

## Sharing/reusing code

- I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.
- Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). 
- Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. 
- On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class. 
- Except for the take home exams, you are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team.
- On the take home exams all communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

---

## Course components:

- Application exercises: Usually start in class and finish in teams by the next class period, check/no check
- Homework: Individual, lowest score dropped
- Exams: Individual, two take home midterms
- Final project: Team, presentations during scheduled final exam time
- Self paced tutorials: Individual, check/no check

---

## Grading

- Weights of each component are given in the syllabus.
- Class attendance is a firm expectation; frequent absences or tardiness 
will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction.
- The more evidence there is that the class has mastered the material, the 
more generous the curve will be.
